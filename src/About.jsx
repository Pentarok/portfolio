           <p>


I'm a Computer Science student at Murang'a University 
of technology
 with a passion for building interactive 
 and user-friendly web applications.
  Specializing in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), 
  I enjoy solving complex problems with elegant,
   functional code. My focus is on creating responsive 
   designs that enhance the user experience.</p>

   <p>Alongside my journey in technology, 
    I also have a deep love for poetry.
     Just like coding, poetry allows me
      to express creativity, connecting 
      logic with emotion. Whether Iâ€™m 
      writing lines of code or verses, 
      I find fulfillment in crafting 
      beautiful, meaningful work.</p>
